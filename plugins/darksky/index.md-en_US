# DarkSky, full weather forecast

## Introduction

This plugin allows you to get the weather from the DarkSKy.net site which has "real time" data

A presentation is available on this article (in French) : [Article de prÃ©sentation](https://lunarok-domotique.com/plugins-jeedom/dark-sky-meteo-panel/)

The plugin has different refresh rates:

  - every 5 mins: real-time information

  - hourly: hourly forecast

  - daily: daily forecasts (weather, and sunrise and sunset times)

When Jeedom restarts, all the info is retrieved.


## Configuration

The plugin does not have a general configuration.

It is necessary to add an equipment and configure the 2 parameters:

  - which localization equipment (Jeedom or geotrav configuration) will be used for the coordinates of the weather forecast to retrieve

  - the API key of Dark Sky (https://darksky.net/dev/)


## FAQ

> Does the plugin rely on third-party APIs?

Yes, the plugin retrieves the values of Dark Sky

> Does the plugin rely on third party plugins?

Yes, it uses equipment from the geotrav plugin (Location and Route).

> How to use the sunrise / sunset information?

A scenario must be used with the sunrise or sunset time as the trigger. Then use blocks on condition 'A'

## Troubleshooting

> I have no information

It is mandatory to create equipment and fill in the information of the place for which we want to have the weather.
